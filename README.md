# CodeChefPractice
This repository is for programming challenges
You can place your code here so that others may see how you solved problems.
If you are having difficulty with a problem, upload it to the repository and then create an issue for your code so that other people know what problem you are having and may be able to help you fix it.
In your files please include the url to the problem that you are working on so that others may easily find it.
I would recommend everyone take a look at the input test as it shows how to input and print out. It also uses the buffered reader, which to my knowledge, is the fastest method for taking in data.
